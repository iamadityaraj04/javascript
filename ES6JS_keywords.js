//var vs let keyword

// here we can declare var with same name, but by using let we can't do it.
var count=32;
var count=23;
console.log(count);
//we will get error here.
// let count=32;
// let count=23;
// console.log(count);

//const var use to define constant
const n1="Aditya";
console.log(n1);
//give error because we can not change const var.
//n1="A";
